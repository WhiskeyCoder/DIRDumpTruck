# DIRDumpTruck
DIRDumpTruck.py is a no-nonsense, chunky lil' Python script that rolls through your directories and dumps out the full file and folder structure into a neatly formatted .txt file. It's the perfect tool when you need to know exactly what’s hiding where — from top-level folders to the spiciest nested files.
